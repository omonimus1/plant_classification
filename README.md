The current repository contains Davide Pollicino' Honours Project. The project (still under evolution), is the result of three research questions:
* What are possible approaches to feature enginnering for the implementation of a classifier able to distinguish flower variants incredibly similar between them, even at differnt life stages and growth locations;
* Which CNN architecture would offer best performances 
* Is is possible to integrate a machine learning model within a django App, without that this model would first be deployed in a cloud service and exploses via endpoint?

## Web application functionalities
The machine learning model, is the the integrated and used in a Django Web APP, where user are able to:
* Classify a flower
* Leave a feedback related to the prediction
* Save a prediction as favourite
* Register, Login, and gets the user's favourite position.

(Note: manage.py may be located inside the webappClassifier folder :) )
#### Coding style checks adopted
* Coding style: Black
* Python Lint: Flake8, flake8-todos
* mypy (for english type checking)
```
# format folder
black folder_name
# Remote all white spaces from project files
trim .
# Format file to improve syntax in according to flake8 (yes -> 2 times --aggressive)
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive filename.py
