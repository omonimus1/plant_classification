    "This can be used to calculate the probability of a word having a positive or negative connotation (0, 1, or on a scale between). Or it can be used to determine the object contained in a photo (tree, flower, grass, etc.), with each object given a probability between 0 and 1. \n",

    "Regression is a method of modelling a target valyeu based on independent predctors. Regression technique differ based on the number of independent variables and type of relationship between indepependent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. \n",

    "\n",
    "A Line of best fit is a straight line that represents the best approximation of a scatter plot of data points.  It is used to study the nature of the relationship between those points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation to find the best fitting line is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Y` = bX + A```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where, Y` denotes the predicted value, b denotes the slope of the line, X denotes the independent variable, A is the Y intercept\n",
